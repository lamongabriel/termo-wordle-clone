# What is Termo Clone? 
[Termo](https://term.ooo/) is an adaptation of the famous [NY Times game Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) into Brazilian Portuguese, developed by Fernando Serboncini. This project is a clone of termo, developed from the ground-up. This is a study project, developed with JavaScript ES6,  HTML and CSS, all credits goes to the creators of Termo and Wordle.
# How it Works?
This project works a little differently from the originals, each time the page is loaded, a different word is random picked from an array 18431 words. Your goal is to get it right in 6 chances, everytime you guess a word, youâ€™ll get clues of the letters this word contains.
# How to Play it?
In every round, you must input a valid word in the Brazilian Portuguese language, doing so you can receive 3 different types of tips to hit the correct word.
## Green Letters:
The letters that turn to green, means that the correct word have the same letter in the same position.
## Yellow Letters:
The letters that turn yellow, means they are in the correct word, but in a different position.
## Red Letters:
All the red letters are not in the final word.
